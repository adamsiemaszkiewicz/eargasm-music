# Summary

The idea behind this repo is to use the large dataset of track published to my music blog [eargasm music](https://open.spotify.com/user/eargasmusic?si=fnwCvcPhTNeBUMDxP4mx1A). There're over 3000 tracks in the database collected throughout the years and assigned to almost 30 different playlists. I divided my work into three main categories:
1. [Data Retrieval](#data-retrieval)
2. [Data Exploration](#data-exploration)
3. [Playlist Classification](#playlist-classification)
